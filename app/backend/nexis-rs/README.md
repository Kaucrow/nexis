## Authentication
This API uses **PASETO v4** tokens for secure authentication. The authentication process is structured as follows:

1. **Login and Cookie Assignment**:     
    When a user logs in, the API creates a PASETO token with the following claims:

    * A **session UUID**, unique to this login session.
    * If the user selected "Remember Me", their **role** and their **user ID** from the database is also added to the token. This token is then stored as a cookie on the client.

    This token is referred to as the session's "**public**" token.

2. **Session Storage in Redis**:    
    In Redis, a key-value pair is created to store the session data:

    * The **key** is the session UUID prefixed to distinguish it as a session key.
    * The **value** is a second PASETO token that securely holds all necessary session data.

    This Redis token is referred to as the session's "**data**" token.
3. **Session Verification**:
    * When a user makes an authenticated request, the API decrypts the session's **public** token from the cookie and extracts the session UUID.
    * Using this session UUID, the API attempts to retrieve the corresponding session data token from Redis.
        * **If the Redis session's data token exists:** The token is decrypted, and session data is extracted, allowing verification to succeed.
        * **If the Redis session token is missing:**
            * The API checks if the session can be "renewed" by querying the database using the user ID from the public token.
            * If the user ID is available and the renewal conditions are met, a new session is created in Redis, and verification succeeds.
            * If the user ID is unavailable (e.g., "Remember Me" was not selected) or renewal fails, verification fails.

This approach ensures proper handling of session expiry and allows for secure and flexible session data storage using Redis.

## Endpoints
**NOTE:** Endpoints that have a "Role" description require specific user roles to access. If a user without the required role(s) attempts to access one of these endpoints, or the session cookie is not sent, the following responses will be returned:
* User does not have the required role: `HTTP 401`
```
{
    error: "You do not have the role required to access this endpoint.",
    roleRequired: "client" | "employee" | "admin"
}
```
* Session expired or session is invalid: `HTTP 401`
```
{
    error: "Failed to verify session: Error"
}
```
* Did not receive the "session" cookie: `HTTP 400`
```
{
    error: "Session cookie is missing."
}
```
